As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 0.11.4 or higher.

Changes:
* Properly distinguish interface and energy channels on interfaces
  Before this change, the interface's energy channel was (ab)used as interface channel.
  Even though interface don't consume energy atm, they might in the future. This was also done for consistency,
  to make it less confusing for both players and developers.
  Closes #109

Fixes:
* Fix item duplication when repeating actions in player simulator, Closes #111

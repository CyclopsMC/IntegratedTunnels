As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 1.4.0 or higher.

Fixes:
* Improve handling of inconsistent simulation-mode transfer failures

  No more console warning will be logged.
  Instead, the error will be shown in the respective part.

  Items will be emitted into the world (disableable),
  and other ingredient types will be voided
  upon such errors.

  Parts will now go in error-mode once such an error occurs
  to avoid ingredients continuously going lost.
